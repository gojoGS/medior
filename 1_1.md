# Request lifecycle

1. Filters: checkpoints that validate, modify or track the request at a servlet level
2. Dispatch Servlet: dispatch the request to the appropriate handler using the HandlerMapping registry.
3. Interceptors: fine grained control over requests and responses adding model attributes; Pre-process interceptors ie.: preHandle
4. Handler method runs
5. Interceptors.: postHandle, validating responses
6. Building and compressing the response, view resolution happens in this stage
7. Interceptors: afterCompletion
8. Filters on the way out

asd

1. Servlet Filters (container level, before DispatcherServlet)
  * e.g., logging, security, CORS
2. DispatcherServlet (front controller entry point)
3. Handler Interceptors – preHandle()
  * Runs before the controller method
  * Often used for authentication, request preprocessing
4. Handler (Controller method)
  * Business logic execution
  * Delegates to services/repositories as needed
5. Handler Interceptors – postHandle()
  * Runs after the controller but before view rendering
  * Good for adding model attributes or modifying responses
6. View Resolution / Response Handling
  * @RestController → JSON/XML via HttpMessageConverter

  filters wrap around the entire DispatcherServlet process, while interceptors wrap around handler execution inside the DispatcherServlet.
  * @Controller → ViewResolver selects template
7. Handler Interceptors – afterCompletion()
  * Called after the view is rendered / response body is written
  * Good for resource cleanup, performance logging
8. Servlet Filters (again, on the way out)
  * Response modifications, headers, logging
